# Junologue Chorus for Move Everything

Juno-60 chorus emulation module based on [junologue-chorus](https://github.com/peterall/junologue-chorus) by Peter Allwin.

Faithful reproduction of the Roland Juno-60 BBD chorus with three classic modes.

## Features

- Three chorus modes: I, I+II, and II
- Two triangle LFOs at fixed rates matching Juno-60 hardware (0.513 Hz and 0.863 Hz)
- Delay times from hardware measurements by Andy Harman
- Adjustable dry/wet mix with equal-power crossfade
- Brightness control for pre/post filtering
- Soft limiter on input
- Works as an audio FX in Signal Chain patches
